<h2>Project Descrition</h2>
The published here was created during Lukas Lammers' master's thesis with the title “Von der Karte zum interaktiven Modell: Franz Kreuters Topographische Sammlung als Virtual-Reality-Anwendung” in 2023. The project was already prepared in 2022 and was completed in early 2024.
The aim was to create a 3D model from the so-called Kreuter'schen Karten, a collection in the Historisches Archiv mit Rhenischem Bildarchiv of the City of Cologne. A video, a desktop application and a virtual reality application were developed based on this model. These three media were compared with each other in user studies.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
The main-branch contains two folders according to the applications. The C#-Scripts themselves, wich were used in Unity, are unstructured.

<h2>External Resources</h2>
The applications are published via Zenodo. This links to the desktop-app Kreuter_3D: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8270942

The Video can be found on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhEugtEpMKc

The 3D-Model can be found in the Repository of the FIDBau digital.
